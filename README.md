### Candy Clean

#### Objective
Clean up the data a little bit, everything is brought in as a string more or less. Thus the 'Age' variable has a lot non-numeric inputs, the main problem I tackle with this data. Labels are messy, there is a lot of missing data // mislabelled data. Export as a spreadsheet document. 

Test html output and features, such as scrollable windows and tabs.
