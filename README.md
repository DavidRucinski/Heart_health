### Heart_health

#### Data
For more information about the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

#### Objective
Practice machine learning techniques (regressions/ supervised learning) and ggplot2 visualizations. With the information given this dataset has a variable 'Target' which indicates the presence of heart disease at '1' and no heart disease at '0'. Trying out different models and see what I can come up with. Along the way I will do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) via visuals to see if anything really sticks out, and try different styles for those graphs. 

The data will need some formatting/cleaning as far as variable names and class/type.

*Note: Some assumptions will be ignored for the sake of just practicing code in R, thus no interpretation will be given for results*
